            "Phrases": "I worked my whole life to complete the home church foundation. I did it throughout the world, but even though you just do it locally, you can establish the same condition. When I gave you permission to do it, I gave you the most precious present in the whole world, the most important thing I have. Don't think that home church is a passing thing. It is the precious result I worked for."

            "Phrases": "God is near you. His concern for each of you exceeds that of anyone else. Everyone thinks that their own parents love them the most, but God's love is greater and deeper than that love; it is deeper and greater than any human love in this world. Hence, you should become people who can feel Gods loving embrace and call Him Father. You should become true sons and daughters who can experience God's internal heart, in the position where you can say, \"Now I know my Father's sorrow.\" If you can become such sons and daughters, you will become the owners of the kingdom of heaven in which you attend God. No one will be able to take that kingdom away from you."

            "Phrases": "TM speech: After True Father's Seonghwa, I was in an indescribable position in which I was all alone. There were many elder members but I could not consider them for advice because they could not see the providence. We had to conduct the Seonghwa Ceremony in a place where heads of state in all nations in the world recognized True Parents' status at the national level per Heaven's criteria. However, even though situations should not have occurred, I was in the position of having to finish the providence alone. It felt as if I had to find a small needle in an environment where I could not open my eyes as a sandstorm was blowing in a desolate desert. With this unimaginable heart I, alone, found that needle."

            "Phrases": "Here is Mr. Bleu. The other day, he told me that when his son, who is an American member, was blessed to a Brazilian bride, they couldn't even speak at all to one another. He honestly couldn't believe that their marriage would last very long. But as time went on, they came to understand each other better and better and they gave birth to a beautiful son who turned out to be a genius. He felt that child was of a completely different seed, different lineage. He was so impressed that he himself decided to join the Unification Church. This is the kind of testimony which people around the world will be able to give. This is what heaven is all about."

            "Phrases": "I made the condition to be welcomed by world Christianity. On Christmas Eve 1994, I returned on the foundation of the victory won by the mobile team and united people from ten nations. The Deputy Director of the National Security Department, Chul-hui Lee married a Japanese woman representing the bride realm, at the time of President Park Chung Hee, right? [Yes.] Everyone opposed us in unison. How harshly the Christians persecuted us! We fought with the support of the government. I won the victory at the national level and the national standard Jesus lost, and united the global Christian cultural sphere."
